## Streamline ASP.NET CORE Development with Azure DevOps

Azure DevOps offers a suite of cloud-based tools to simplify ASP.NET CORE development. This empowers developers to focus on building great applications.

**Key benefits of Azure DevOps for ASP.NET CORE developers:**

* **Centralized Management:** Manage code (Azure Repos), automate builds and deployments (Azure Pipelines), and track work (Azure Boards) - all in one place.
* **Improved Collaboration:** Facilitate teamwork using features like pull requests, code reviews, and work item linking.
* **Enhanced Testing:** Create and execute manual and automated tests (Azure Test Plans) for comprehensive quality assurance.
* **Simplified Package Management:** Share and manage code packages (Azure Artifacts) for streamlined development.
* **Detailed Monitoring:** Gain insights into application performance and health (Azure Monitor) for proactive problem-solving.

**Getting Started with Azure DevOps**

1. **Set up your project:** Create a project in Azure DevOps and choose Git for version control.
2. **Develop your application:** Use Visual Studio or any IDE to code your ASP.NET CORE MVC application.
3. **Configure CI/CD:** Create pipelines in Azure DevOps using YAML or a graphical editor to automate building, testing, and deploying your application.
4. **Manage work and track progress:** Utilize Azure Boards to create work items, track tasks, and link them to code commits for better organization.
5. **Implement automated testing:** Design test plans in Azure Test Plans to execute unit and integration tests for your application.
6. **Manage packages:** Establish artifact feeds in Azure DevOps to share and manage NuGet or npm packages for your project.
7. **Monitor application health:** Set up monitoring in Azure DevOps to leverage Application Insights or Log Analytics for performance insights.

By adopting Azure DevOps, ASP.NET CORE developers can streamline their workflow, improve collaboration, and deliver high-quality applications faster.
