In the app there is three type of budgeting
1-Monthly Budgets
2-Short term budgets ( less than a year )
3-Long term budgets ( More than a year )

*For creating a goal we use SMART approach*

# Monthly budgets ( Needs )

- Each category is assigned a monthly budget, *which may vary from the preceding month*. 
- The system generates a Budget Plan for the upcoming month, with the default value set as the **average** of the previous months. 
- Users have the flexibility to modify the allocated value as needed.
- In the monthly budget if the user has a data about the expenses and the incomes system calculate the percentage of the categories and based On that offers a value for the next month budget which may change by user but if the user doesn't have any data the user it self must assign the value for them!


# Short term budgets(Wants)
User can create a goal for less than year like buying a new phone and the necessary data are 
1. what is a goal?
2. the cost of goal?
3. time period of the goal.
the short term budgets get more percentage of the income 

# Long  term budgets(Goals)
User can create a goal for more than year like buying a new house and the necessary data are 
1. what is a goal?
2. the cost of goal?
3. time period of the goal.
the long term budgets get less percentage of the income
